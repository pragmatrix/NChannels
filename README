This is a small hack to support a very limited subset of the channel concept of Go (or Newsqueak) for .NET 4.

Supported are

- Synchronous, single value channels.
- Select without default paths.

For examples, take a look at the testcases in the directory NChannels.Tests.

Some inspirations were taken from:
